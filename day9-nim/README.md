# Day 9 - Nim
Nim is a fun language. It mostly feels like writing Python, but with some extra features. Typing is, of course, very nice to have. And it's easy to define new types too, whether simple tuples or large OOP-style classes. I also like the option of calling functions with dot notation, e.g. `myList.len` is equivalent to `len(myList)` (or `len myList` or `myList.len()`, for that matter). The `case` expression, the range operator (`0..10`), and the everything-is-an-expression nature of the language also feel like improvements over Python.

I also like how easy it is to get started with Nim. Everything works how you expect it to, at least for the basic aspects of the language. 

If there's one complaint I have about Nim, it's just that feels a bit immature and rough around the edges. It has a pretty small ecosystem, and the error messages aren't always very helpful.
