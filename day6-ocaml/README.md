# Day 6 - OCaml
As clean and reliable as the ML languages may be, it doesn't change the fact that they are very difficult to reason about. And I don't think it's just a matter of what's familiar, either. They're just inherently tough. I had to resign myself to a pretty poor time complexity for this problem because of that.

There's no doubt that working with OCaml or another ML-family language is a great exercise for one's FP muscles, though. When it comes to FP-focused languages for anything practical, I'd pick Elixir or Scala any day.

One nice thing I will say about OCaml is that it's website and introductory materials feel very inviting. It gives the sense of a devoted and welcoming community.
