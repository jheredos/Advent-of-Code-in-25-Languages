# Day 4 - Ruby
Despite having almost no experience with Ruby, it was very easy to use, no doubt because it so closely resembles languages like Python and JavaScript that I use so often. While it's expressive and easy to use, I don't find anything particularly interesting or special about Ruby. I find the `end` keyword to be a bit clunky (same with Elixir), and I find the optional parentheses around function parameters just makes things more ambiguous for someone unfamiliar with the language (in fact, the same could be said for Elixir, Scala, and Perl!).
