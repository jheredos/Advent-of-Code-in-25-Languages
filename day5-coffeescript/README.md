# Day 5 - CoffeeScript
CoffeeScript will always have a special place in my heart. It was the first language that I used professionally, and I've always loved how expressive it is while also being fully compatible with the JavaScript ecosystem. It's even more readable than Python in some ways, like with the range operator or postfix conditionals.

I can see why it fell out of style, though. JavaScript isn't terribly verbose as it is, and CoffeeScript's whitespace-heavy syntax can feel more ambiguous than having everything neatly delimited with parentheses, braces, and semicolons. Of course, JavaScript's biggest shortcoming isn't its verbosity, it's its lack of types.

Besides, a lot of the best features of CoffeeScript have already been assimilated into JavaScript. Object and array destructuring, the splat operator `...`, arrow functions, the optional chaining operator `?.` and the `?` operator (indirectly, with the nullish coalescing operator `??`).

Perhaps JavaScript will assimilate type annotations someday too, and then TypeScript will go the way of CoffeeScript.
