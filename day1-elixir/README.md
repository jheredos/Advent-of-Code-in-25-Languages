# Day 1 - Elixir
Starting with something somewhat familiar. I've dabbled in Elixir before, though I've never built anything serious with it. It is a fun language, though one pain point for me is the breadth of the standard library. There is a module for everything, but unless you're very familiar with the language all that means is a lot of scanning through documentation. 

My favorite feature is the pipe operator (`|>`). It encourages such a clean and readable format. Though I wasn't able to use it much here, I also enjoy Elixir's pattern matching, whether in assignment, function definitions, or the `case` expression.

Elixir always feels a bit strange to me. It's not that it's a functional language; it feels very different than functional JavaScript or even Scala. I think it's that idiomatic Elixir leans heavily on features that are missing or less used in FP in other languages, like the `|>` and the pattern matching and the module system.
