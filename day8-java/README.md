# Day 8 - Java
I am not a fan of Java. 

For one, I don't like how verbose it is. Why always mark public/private methods? Why not pick one as the default? 

Also, why are there so many collection classes? Why are there so many classes generally? One issue I have with Elixir is that there is a funciton for everything, but unless you use the module a lot, you'll either end up writing your own version or browse endlessly through the docs looking for just the right thing. 

Java is even worse. Just reading the input file required three imports, and the material I read to understand it also listed 3-4 alternatives. It seems like there ought to one go-to method for reading text input, and either leave the optimization to the compiler or have a handful of alternative methods available for those with very particular goals. 

I also don't like Java's forcing you into OOP. I know that Java has added features to facilitate FP in recent year (lambdas?), but it's certainly not built with FP in mind.

If there's one thing preventing me from giving Java a 1/10, it's that at least the basic syntax for variables, conditionals, and loops is familiar and typical of the C family, so it is pretty easy to use in that regard.
