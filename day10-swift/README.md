# Day 10 - Swift
Swift is alright. The syntax is simple and familiar. Walking through the documentation, it seems like it will be very easy to use. In practice though, there are plenty of little gotchas. For example, it's not `someArray.length` but `someArray.count`. `split`ting a string doesn't return a list of strings, but a list of "substrings" that must be converted into strings. Opening the input file was no easy task, either. 

I may have been negatively biased by the difficulty of today's problem, but overall, I'm not impressed with Swift.
