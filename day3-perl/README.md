# Day 3 - Perl
Unlike Elixir and Scala, I'd never written so much as a "Hello World" in Perl prior to today's problem. I was pleasantly suprised to find that MacOS comes with Perl pre-installed, and as strange as the syntax looks at first glance, it was pretty easy to get started. I opted for Perl since today's problem dealt with strings, and I knew that was a strong point for Perl. 

The sigils (`$`, `@`, `%`) seem ugly at first, but they turn out to be very useful. Being able to treat one type like another, an array (`@`) as a scalar (`$`), for instance, can make for very concise and expressive syntax. The many built-in variables also keep things very concise, like accessing a function's arguments from the default array variable `@_`, or accessing the current item in a loop with `$_`. It seems like those are just scratching the surface, and the docs were full of uses of hidden variables that felt like magic. As I expected, it's also very easy to work with strings and regular expressions. 

Perl was a very positive experience, and if another string-heavy problem comes up, I may try out Raku (formerly Perl 6).
